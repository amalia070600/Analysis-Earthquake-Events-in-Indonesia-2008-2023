# Analysis-Earthquake-Events-in-Indonesia-2008-2023
This project aims to analyze earthquake activity across Indonesia using data from Kaggle. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I explore patterns of magnitude, depth, and frequency to better understand Indonesia’s earthquake characteristics.

<h2>Project Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Understand seismic patterns in Indonesia (2008–2023)</li>
  <li>Identify high-risk areas based on earthquake frequency and magnitude</li>
  <li>Analyze earthquake characteristics (depth vs. magnitude)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Real-World Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Increase awareness of regions that are most frequently affected by earthquakes</li>
  <li>Identify whether there are specific temporal patterns in earthquake occurrences</li>
  <li>Analyze which type of earthquake (shallow vs. deep) poses greater risk</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dataset Overview</h2>
This project utilizes the "Earthquake in Indonesia (katalog_gempa.csv)" dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle. The dataset can be accessed by <a href="#https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kekavigi/earthquakes-in-indonesia">clicking here.</a>

This dataset contains records of earthquake events in Indonesia from 2008 to 2023. The dataset includes the following attributes:
<ul>
  <li>tgl : Date of the event </li>
  <li>ot : Timestamp of the event</li>
  <li>lat : Latitude of the earthquake epicenter (in degrees), ranging from 6°N to 11°S</li>
  <li>lon : Longitude of the earthquake epicenter (in degrees), ranging from 94°E to 142°E</li>
  <li>depth : Depth of the event (in kilometers)</li>
  <li>mag : Magnitude of the event, ranging from 1 to 7.9</li>
  <li>remark : Flinn-Engdahl region of the event</li>
</ul>
